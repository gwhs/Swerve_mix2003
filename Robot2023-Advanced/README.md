# Ri3D Redux 2023 Robot Code

Robot code for [Robot in 3 Days Redux](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/new-ri3d-team-in-2023-peoria-il-applications-open/415193).

The is one of two repositories being prepped. It is more "all bells and whistles" and may get used if we get to the point of needing to integrate pathplanning and vision processing.

Key highlights:

 * Hardware wrapper infrastructure to support simulation and flexible hardware configurations
 * Physics-based swerve drive simulation
 * NT4 Annotation-based infrastructure to put key class members into network tables
 * Custom timeline-based autonomous routine selector and sequencer
 * [PathPlanner](https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner)-based holonomic autonomous paths
 * (WIP) Apriltag pose estimation 
 * Web-based driver dashboard & debugging infrastructure
 * Field-relative positioning through non-linear state estimation
